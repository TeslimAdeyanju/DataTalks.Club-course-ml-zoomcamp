<h2>Description</h2>

The purpose of this repository is to share my assignments, notes, and insights with the general public as I progress through the course over the next three months. 
I will be studying a comprehensive Machine Learning course that covers key topics such as:

- Machine Learning for Regression  
- Machine Learning for Classification
- Evaluation Metrics for Classification
- Deploying Machine Learning Models
- Decision Trees and Ensemble Learning
- Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- Serverless Deep Learning
- Kubernetes and TensorFlow Serving

I believe in the power of Learning in Public and hope these resources will be helpful for others on a similar learning path.

This course is organized by DataTalks.Club, and the best way to get support is through their Slack community. If you’re taking the course, I highly recommend joining the #course-ml-zoomcamp channel on Slack.

Let’s learn and grow together!
